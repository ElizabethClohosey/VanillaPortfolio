              <p>
                A concise overview that mentions my coding journey, tech stack,
                and a quick nod to your hobbies and medical background. This
                sets the stage without overwhelming with detail.
              </p>
              <p>
                My coding journey: A brief origin story — how and why you got
                into software development.
              </p>
              <p>
                My tech stack: Mention what you work with most and what excites
                you about coding.
              </p>
              <p>
                Current goals: Highlight your continuous learning mindset — like
                exploring back-end development or building ChromaCSS.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’m a fullstack software developer with a passion for building
                intuitive web applications. After years of experience in the
                medical field and four years of hospital volunteering, I
                transitioned into tech to solve problems creatively. When I’m
                not coding, you’ll find me snowboarding or exploring new hiking
                trails.

            <section class="hobbies">
              <h3>Hobbies</h3>
              <p>
                A dedicated space to talk about my love for snowboarding and
                hiking — maybe with a fun fact or a story.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I step away from the screen, I chase adrenaline and fresh
                mountain air. Snowboarding has taught me persistence and risk
                management (both on the slopes and in coding), while hiking
                helps me clear my head and spark new ideas.
              </p>

            <section class="medical-experience">
              <h3>Medical Experience</h3>
              <p>
                A thoughtful summary of your experience in the medical field and
                how that shaped your problem-solving and empathy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before diving into tech, I spent years in the medical field,
                where I learned to approach challenges with care and precision.
                I also volunteered at a hospital for four years during high
                school — an experience that continues to influence how I
                collaborate and build thoughtful applications.
              </p>
              <p>
                After several years in the medical field, I transitioned into
                software development, where I bring the same passion for helping
                people — now through building thoughtful, intuitive applications
              </p>

              <h3>Volunteer Work</h3>
              <p>
                My journey into tech wasn’t direct — I spent four years
                volunteering at a hospital in high school, which taught me
                patience, teamwork, and the value of solving real-world
                problems. That same mindset now fuels my passion for building
                applications that make a difference
