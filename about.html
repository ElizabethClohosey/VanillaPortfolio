            My coding journey: A brief origin story — how and why you got into
            software development.

            My tech stack: Mention what you work with most and what excites you

            I’m a fullstack software developer with a passion for building
            intuitive web applications. After years of experience in the medical
            field and four years of hospital volunteering, I transitioned into
            tech to solve problems creatively. When I’m not coding, you’ll find
            me snowboarding or exploring new hiking trails.

          <p>
            After several years in the medical field, I transitioned into
            software development, where I bring the same passion for helping
            people — now through building thoughtful, intuitive applications

          <h3>Volunteer Work</h3>
          <p>
            My journey into tech wasn’t direct — I spent four years volunteering
            at a hospital in high school, which taught me patience, teamwork,
            and the value of solving real-world problems. That same mindset now
            fuels my passion for building applications that make a difference
