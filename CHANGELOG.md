# Portfolio Change Log

## Document Purpose
This changelog serves as a clear and concise record of updates made to my frontend portfolio. It tracks visual, functional, and content-related changes across versions, with the goal of:
- Documenting design updates, UI/UX improvements, and accessibility enhancements
- Tracking new sections, project additions, or layout refinements
- Providing transparency into how the portfolio evolves over time
- Supporting maintenance and version control
- Demonstrating attention to detail and a thoughtful development process

This log is primarily intended for personal reference, potential employers, and collaborators who may review the projectâ€™s development history.
